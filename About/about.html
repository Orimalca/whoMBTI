      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>As third-year computer science students at the College of Management, we created this project as a demonstration of our deep learning skills</p>
	  <p>Our objective is to enable individuals to classify themselves as one of 16 personality types using their Reddit activity by leveraging the MBTI model.</p>
	  <p><h4>What is the MBTI model?</h4><p>
	  <p>The MBTI model, developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers, is a widely used personality assessment tool that categorizes people into 16 personality types based on their preferences in four different areas: Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I), Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N), Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F), and Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P). While the MBTI is frequently employed in career counseling, team building, and personal development, it is important to bear in mind that it is not a scientifically validated measure of personality and should be used cautiously</p>
